TODO: will add soon the powerful replacer script after removing company specific  data, which I am using to create component, types,reducers ,actions,middleware and basic tests also, saving **100+ lines** of manual typing, which was the main motivation behind this vscode extension.<br/><br/>
This repository contains examples of programmatic templates for the vscode extension at: https://github.com/sktguha/programmaticTemplates.
